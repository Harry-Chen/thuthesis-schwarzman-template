The Group Capstone Project is an important part of the Schwarzman College curriculum.
It is a client-based analytical project that serves as a culminating academic and
intellectual experience for students of Schwarzman Scholars Program.
A team of 3-5 students is voluntarily formed under the guidance of a faculty advisor to conduct in-depth research,
develop solutions and compose final reports on a topic proposed by a public, private or social partner organization.

The Group Capstone project aims to train students to take advantage of team membersâ€™ diverse cultural and academic backgrounds,
encourage broader understanding, exercise leadership and propose practical and innovative research solutions to real-world
challenges. It is a comprehensive learning experience which allows students to interact with the partner organization,
and to learn in a cross-cultural and cross-disciplinary team.
With the extraordinary diversity and talents assembled at Schwarzman,
the college collaborate with partner organizations to inspire students
to develop solutions and to make a positive impact to the world.
