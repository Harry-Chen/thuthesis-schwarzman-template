\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Background}

Tsinghua requires that Chapter 1 be regarded as the Introduction and the final Chapter be regarded as the Conclusion. Consecutively number the pages of your paper, beginning with the Introduction page, throughout the end. Use centered Arabic numerals (1, 2, 3 etc.) at the bottom of each page. Indent the first word of a paragraph 0.74 cm from the left margin, and you can use the tab key of your word-processing program to achieve the indentation (the default setting is likely already 0.74 cm).
